# Lecture 1 - A brief introduction to C

In these exercises you will implement a doubly-linked list to ensure you understand pointers.

Read the comments in the exerciseN.c files and implement the functions suggested (and any other helpers you think suitable).

The supplied Makefile will build the executables if you run
```
make exerciseN
```
